# Work Day Scheduler Updates

## Updates
To make this work day scheduler work, I first had to add the containers for the time blcoks to go in along with the various ids and classes that would be used to format and update the scheduler. After adding the time blocks, I added the media query to the style sheet. For the JavaScript, I first added today's date and time to the top of the calendar. Next, I added the function to make sure that the save button worked on the scheduler when text is added. I also created a function that changed the color of the time slot based on the current time (grey for past, red for present, and green for future). The last thing that I added was the ability for any data added to local storage to be pulled when they pull up the scheduler on their device.
